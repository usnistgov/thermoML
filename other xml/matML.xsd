Revisions      
                    MatML Version 3.0 Schema (henceforth referred to as MatML 3.0)  is an enhancement of the previously released Annotated MatML DTD Version 2.0 (henceforth referred to as MatML 2.0) and addresses the technical issues identified during the June 2001 NIST workshop entitled "The Technical and Strategic Future of MatML.” In addition to these revisions, the author reorganized several content models and renamed some elements to improve the clarity of the language.

Schema      
                    MatML 3.0 is expressed in XML Schema Definition Language and conforms to World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C)      http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.      

Redundancy      
                    Sample instance documents encoded using MatML 2.0 illustrated that descriptions of properties,measurement techniques, data sources, and parameters could be repeated many timesthroughout a document. This issue has been addressed by the introduction of the Metadataelement, which, in addition to the previously mentioned descriptions, includes another newelement, SpecimenDetails, for encoding descriptions of specimens.  
      
Units 
                    MatML 2.0 represented units as a simple string and permitted embedded HTML tags. MatML 3.0 uses the Units content model developed by Dr. Edward J. Shaya of NASA Goddard Space FlightCenter for the eXtensible Data Format (XDF) language version 0.17 found at http://xml.gsfc.nasa.gov/DTD/XDF_017.dtd.      

Uncertainty      
                    MatML 2.0 did not provide for measurement uncertainty. MatML 3.0 includes a new element, Uncertainty, for encoding this information and was constructed based upon the recommendationsof Dr. Ron Munro of NIST's Ceramics Division (MSEL) and Dr. Raghu Kacker of NIST's Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division in the Information Technology Laboratory. 
Glossary      
                    The Terms element in MatML 2.0 has been replaced by the Glossary element in MatML 3.0, which uses a simplified content model for encoding terms instead of the Virtual HyperGlossary(TM) markup      language.      
Composites      
                    MatML 3.0 includes the revisions proposed by the MatML Composites Working Group. These changes include recursion of the ComponentDetails element as well as new attributes on the Material element (id, layers, local_frame_of_reference) and the ComponentDetails element (id). 
Nesting             
                    The MatML ASM-MSC Data Exchange Focus Group reported difficulties validating MatML 2.0 instance documents where multiple element tuples were encoded within a single element (Compound, PropertyDetails, etc.). Multiple element tuples have been eliminated in MatML 3.0 and have beenreplaced by nested content models.

This element declares the content model for Material, which contains materials data. Material has three optional attributes. 

The first attribute, id, may be used as an identification specifier for the material, which is especially useful for complex systems such as composite laminates.

The second attribute, layers, may be used to indicate the number of layers in complex systems such as composite laminates.

The third attribute, local_frame_of_reference, may be used as an identification specifier for the local material orientation relative to the global frame of reference, which is especially useful for complex systems such as anisotropic materials.

Material is composed of the following elements:

BulkDetails contains a description of the bulk material and must occur once and only once within the Material element. For additional information, see the documentation for the BulkDetails element.

ComponentDetails contains a description of a component within the bulk material and may occur zero or more times within the Material element. ComponentDetails may be used to describe complex materials systems such as welds (e.g. the base metal, the heat affected zone, and the weld metal) or composites (e.g. the whiskers, fibers, and matrix of a fiber-reinforced composite material). For additional information, see the documentation for the ComponentDetails element.

Metadata contains descriptions of the data sources,  properties, measurement techniques, specimens, and parameters which are referenced when materials property data are encoded using the PropertyData element. Metadata may occur once or not at all within the Material element. For more information, see the documentation for the Metadata element.

Graphs contains descriptions of two dimensional graphics and may occur once or not at all within the Material element. For additional information, see the documentation for the Graphs element.

Glossary contains descriptions of the material and property terms used in the document and may occur once or not at all within the Material element. For additional information, see the documentation for the Glossary element.</xsd:documentation>

This element declares the content model for Units, which contains units and has four optional attributes.

The first attribute, system, is used to indicate the units system, such as "SI." 

The second attribute, factor, is used to indicate a constant multiplier in floating point format.

The third attribute, name, is used to indicate the name of the units. 

The fourth attribute, description, is used to describe the units.

Units is composed of the following elements. 
Unit contains a unit and must occur one or more times within the Units element. For additional information, see the documentation for the Unit element.

Note -   Multiple Unit elements are multiplied together to form the units. Division is specified by using setting the power attribute of Unit equal to "-1."</xsd:documentation>
